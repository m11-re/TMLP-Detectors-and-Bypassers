## Bypassers

Currently, SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + Zygisk Next (v1.3.0 and later) is the optimal root and Zygisk bypassing combination, followed by Magisk Alpha + Zygisk Next (v1.3.0 and later), Apatch + Cherish Peekaboo + Zygisk Next (v1.3.0 and later), and Magisk Delta + built-in Zygisk. 

Given the following definitions, the development of bypassing can be briefly described as follows. 

1) We define Magisk Fork as rooting solutions, including Magisk, KSU, Apatch, and their branches. 
2) We define Zygisk Fork as built-in Zygisk and alternative Zygisk implementations. 
3) We define LSPosed Fork as LSPosed and its branches. 

- Magisk + Xposed (2018 and before), 
- Magisk + Edxposed (2019), 
- Magisk + Edxposed + Anti-detection plugins (2020), 
- Magisk + LSPosed (2021), 
- Magisk + Zygisk + Shamiko + LSPosed (2022), 
- Magisk Fork + Zygisk Fork + Shamiko + LSPosed (2023), 
- Magisk Fork + Zygisk Fork + Shamiko + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS (2024), 
- Magisk Fork + Zygisk Fork + SUSFS/Shamiko/Zygisk Assistant + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS (the first season in 2025), 
- Magisk Fork + Zygisk Fork + SUSFS/Shamiko/NoHello + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS + VBMeta Fixer + Cleanup (the second season in 2025), 
- SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + Zygisk Next (v1.2.9.1 and before) + Shamiko + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS + VBMeta Fixer + Audit Patch + Cleanup (the third season in 2025), and
- SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + Zygisk Next (v1.3.0 and later) + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS + VBMeta Fixer + Audit Patch + Cleanup (the fourth season in 2025). 

Currently, even with the state-of-the-art bypassing techniques, the following problems still cannot be solved with appropriate solutions. 

- Hide custom ROMs
- Hide USB debugging and even developer options without injection traces detected
- Hide accessibility mode (even the affected application cannot detect accessibility mode) without injection traces detected
- Solve the problem that WeChat fails to enable fingerprint payment while all other applications can use it normally
- Solve the problem that the STRONG integrity check cannot be passed on devices with the bootloader unlocked when there is no valid keybox
- Hide injection traces for applications injected at the application level

While following the tutorials, please also consider referring to the documentation and the ``Actions`` tab of the GitHub repositories for each rooting solution, module, and plugin, if there are.

    - Install the latest [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/releases) module in the SukiSU Ultra layer (If you are using Zygisk Next version ``1.2.9.1`` or lower, please also consider installing the latest [Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases/) module in the SukiSU Ultra layer, and then create an empty file named ``whitelist`` under ``/data/adb/shamiko/``, or execute the command ``touch /data/adb/shamiko/whitelist`` with root privileges)
      - Set the denylist policy to ``Unmount Only`` (or execute ``/data/adb/modules/zygisksu/bin/zygiskd enforce-denylist just_umount`` with root privileges) (finally make the content of ``/data/adb/zygisksu/denylist_enforce`` to ``2``)
      - To prevent some applications from not running properly, it is recommended to disable ``Use anonymous memory`` (or execute ``/data/adb/modules/zygisksu/bin/zygiskd memory-type default`` with root privileges) (finally make the content of ``/data/adb/zygisksu/memory_type`` to ``0``) (this configuration takes effect after rebooting)
      - To prevent some applications from not running properly, it is recommended to disable ``Use Zygisk Next linker`` (or execute ``/data/adb/modules/zygisksu/bin/zygiskd linker system``) (finally make the content of ``/data/adb/zygisksu/linker`` to ``0``) (this configuration takes effect after rebooting)
      - Please keep the switches of ``Use anonymous memory`` and ``Use Zygisk Next linker`` in the same state to avoid being detected
      - Remove the Shamiko, NoHello, and Zygisk Assistant modules, as well as their related folders in ``/data/adb``
      - Reboot the device
    - Install the latest [LSPosed](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed/actions) module (the latest Release version in the last successful CI construction action in the ``Actions`` tab of the GitHub repository of the ``Jing Matrix`` fork) in the SukiSU Ultra layer
      - Reboot $\rightarrow$ Open the LSPosed Manager $\rightarrow$ Create the LSPosed daemon $\rightarrow$ Create a desktop shortcut to the LSPosed daemon $\rightarrow$ Disable the logs, which could make the LSPosed detectable $\rightarrow$ Disable the LSPosed taskbar notification in the settings page of the LSPosed daemon $\rightarrow$ Uninstall the LSPosed Manager
      - Input ``*#*#5776733#*#*`` in the dialer (do not call) or click the ``action`` button in the module detail in the SukiSU Ultra manager to open the LSPosed daemon if necessary (or in case the desktop shortcut is missing)
      - Install the latest [HMA](https://t.me/HideMyApplist) plugin (the latest build in its Telegram) in the LSPosed layer
      - Set the target scope of the HMA plugin to **System Framework** only and enable the HMA plugin in the LSPosed Manager
      - Reboot the device
      - Configure the HMA
        - Hide HMA's icon from the launcher in HMA's settings page
        - Set the three switches in Data Isolation to ``On``, ``Off``, and ``On`` in sequence in the HMA's settings page (may require root privileges)
        - Build appropriate whitelist (what applications the detectors can see) or blacklist (what applications the detectors cannot see) templates (can refer to [this tutorial](./HMA(L).md))
        - Except for the SukiSU Ultra Manager and the plugins, enable hiding for all user applications and system-pre-installed non-critical applications with suitable templates applied
    - Install the latest [Play Integrity fix](https://github.com/KOWX712/PlayIntegrityFix/actions) module in the SukiSU Ultra layer (See [https://github.com/TMLP-Team/TMLP-Detectors-and-Bypassers/tree/main/Implementers/Others](https://github.com/TMLP-Team/TMLP-Detectors-and-Bypassers/tree/main/Implementers/Others) if the original repository is unavailable)
    - Install the latest [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore) module in the SukiSU Ultra layer
      - Use an alternative ``keybox.xml`` that is not brought from the Tricky Store module by default if you wish to
        - Use the MT Manager to rename the ``keybox.xml`` file in the ``/data/adb/tricky_store/`` directory to ``keybox.xml.bak`` (or execute ``mv /data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml /data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml.bak`` with root privileges)
        - Obtain an alternative ``keybox.xml``
          - Method 1: Search for a free recent ``keybox.xml`` (that can pass at least the Device (old Strong) integrity) in Telegram (like [https://t.me/LSP_Leaks](https://t.me/LSP_Leaks)) $rightarrow$ Download the file $rightarrow$ Rename the file to ``keybox.xml`` $rightarrow$ Use the MT Manager to move it to ``/data/adb/tricky_store/``
          - Method 2: Generate a ``keybox.xml`` (that can pass the Basic (old Device) integrity) in a Linux operating system (via a Python script from [https://github.com/TMLP-Team/keyboxGenerator](https://github.com/TMLP-Team/keyboxGenerator)) $rightarrow$ Copy the generated file entitled ``keybox.xml`` to the Android device $rightarrow$ Use the MT Manager to move it to ``/data/adb/tricky_store/``
          - Method 3: Buy a ``keybox.xml`` (that can pass the Strong integrity) (However, in few cases your device really needs the Strong integrity, and moreover, never buy a ``keybox.xml`` unless you can ensure that the bought ``keybox.xml`` is always valid or a new valid one will be offered for free once the previous one is revoked in the future, since each non-exclusive ``keybox.xml`` will be revoked by Google in a short period usually)
          - Method 4: Use root certificates recognized by Google to generate ``keybox.xml`` (nearly impossible since most of us are plain people)
          - Method 5: Design methods (including a brute-force algorithm that can succeed in a short time) to break the cryptography scheme (impossible since you can publish a paper in the top cryptography conference and make cryptography systems throughout the world in danger if you succeed)
        - Check the integrity if you wish to
          - Google APIs: Use [Key Attestation](https://github.com/vvb2060/KeyAttestation)
            - Your ``keybox.xml`` is announced or expected to at least pass the Device (old Strong) integrity before checking
              - Your ``keybox.xml`` is private and you will not share it publicly: Feel free to check, since Google will most likely not revoke your ``keybox.xml`` as long as there are no multiple Android devices sharing the same ``keybox.xml``
              - Your ``keybox.xml`` is obtained from a public channel or you want to share it publicly: It is acceptable $\leftarrow$ Checking based on the Google APIs will accelerate its revocation by Google as long as your ``keybox.xml`` is checked on multiple Android devices $\leftarrow$ However, if you do not check it manually, you can hardly trust its integrity, and applications that need to check the integrity will sooner or later based on the Google APIs, which will also accelerate its revocation $\leftarrow$ Just use the default ``keybox.xml`` brought from the Tricky Store module or the ``keybox.xml`` generated by yourselves is sufficient if there is no such applications on your Android device
            - Your ``keybox.xml`` is announced or expected to pass the Basic (old Device) integrity before checking: Feel free to check, since the default ``keybox.xml`` brought from the Tricky Store module or the ``keybox.xml`` generated by yourselves can also pass the Basic (old Device) integrity, and they are quite easy to obtain
          - Others: Some other checkers in [https://github.com/TMLP-Team/TMLP-Detectors-and-Bypassers/tree/main/Detectors](https://github.com/TMLP-Team/TMLP-Detectors-and-Bypassers/tree/main/Detectors) check the revoked ``keybox.xml`` based on their own cloud libraries instead of the Google ones
        - Click ``/data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml.bak`` in the MT Manager and restore the backup if the ``keybox.xml`` is revoked or the integrity provided is even worse than that provided by the default ``keybox.xml`` brought from the Tricky Store module
      - Use the MT Manager to extract the installation package names of the target applications and the detectors (long press to copy) $rightarrow$ add them to ``/data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt`` (blacklist mode) line by line
      - ~~Use the MT Manager to write the date of the 1st day of the current month or the current season to ``/data/adb/tricky_store/security_patch.txt`` in the form of ``20251201``~~
    - Install the latest [VBMeta Fixer](https://github.com/reveny/Android-VBMeta-Fixer) module in the SukiSU Ultra layer if the device does not have a proper vbmeta digest
    - Install the latest [Audit Patch](https://github.com/aviraxp/ZN-AuditPatch) module in the SukiSU Ultra layer if necessary for vulnerability fixes
- View [https://www.reddit.com/r/Magisk/comments/1i7sowe/tutorial_susfs_best_root_hiding_method_currently/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Magisk/comments/1i7sowe/tutorial_susfs_best_root_hiding_method_currently/) in English if necessary.

          - Method 2: Generate a ``keybox.xml`` (that can pass the Basic (old Device) integrity) in a Linux operating system (via a Python script from [https://github.com/TMLP-Team/keyboxGenerator](https://github.com/TMLP-Team/keyboxGenerator)) $rightarrow$ Copy the generated file entitled ``keybox.xml`` to the Android device $rightarrow$ Use the MT Manager to move it to ``/data/adb/tricky_store/``
          - Method 3: Buy a ``keybox.xml`` (that can pass the Strong integrity) (However, in few cases your device really needs the Strong integrity, and moreover, never buy a ``keybox.xml`` unless you can ensure that the bought ``keybox.xml`` is always valid or a new valid one will be offered for free once the previous one is revoked in the future, since each non-exclusive ``keybox.xml`` will be revoked by Google in a short period usually)
          - Method 4: Use root certificates recognized by Google to generate ``keybox.xml`` (nearly impossible since most of us are plain people)
          - Method 5: Design methods (including a brute-force algorithm that can succeed in a short time) to break the cryptography scheme (impossible since you can publish a paper in the top cryptography conference and make cryptography systems throughout the world in danger if you succeed)
        - Check the integrity if you wish to
          - Google APIs: Use [Key Attestation](https://github.com/vvb2060/KeyAttestation)
            - Your ``keybox.xml`` is announced or expected to at least pass the Device (old Strong) integrity before checking
              - Your ``keybox.xml`` is private and you will not share it publicly: Feel free to check, since Google will most likely not revoke your ``keybox.xml`` as long as there are no multiple Android devices sharing the same ``keybox.xml``
              - Your ``keybox.xml`` is obtained from a public channel or you want to share it publicly: It is acceptable $\leftarrow$ Checking based on the Google APIs will accelerate its revocation by Google as long as your ``keybox.xml`` is checked on multiple Android devices $\leftarrow$ However, if you do not check it manually, you can hardly trust its integrity, and applications that need to check the integrity will sooner or later based on the Google APIs, which will also accelerate its revocation $\leftarrow$ Just use the default ``keybox.xml`` brought from the Tricky Store module or the ``keybox.xml`` generated by yourselves is sufficient if there is no such applications on your Android device
            - Your ``keybox.xml`` is announced or expected to pass the Basic (old Device) integrity before checking: Feel free to check, since the default ``keybox.xml`` brought from the Tricky Store module or the ``keybox.xml`` generated by yourselves can also pass the Basic (old Device) integrity, and they are quite easy to obtain
          - Others: Some other checkers in [https://github.com/TMLP-Team/TMLP-Detectors-and-Bypassers/tree/main/Detectors](https://github.com/TMLP-Team/TMLP-Detectors-and-Bypassers/tree/main/Detectors) check the revoked ``keybox.xml`` based on their own cloud libraries instead of the Google ones
        - Click ``/data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml.bak`` in the MT Manager and restore the backup if the ``keybox.xml`` is revoked or the integrity provided is even worse than that provided by the default ``keybox.xml`` brought from the Tricky Store module
      - Use the MT Manager to extract the installation package names of the target applications and the detectors (long press to copy) $rightarrow$ add them to ``/data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt`` (blacklist mode) line by line
      - ~~Use the MT Manager to write the date of the 1st day of the current month or the current season to ``/data/adb/tricky_store/security_patch.txt`` in the form of ``20251201``~~
    - Install the latest [VBMeta Fixer](https://github.com/reveny/Android-VBMeta-Fixer) module in the Apatch layer if the device does not have a proper vbmeta digest
    - Install the latest [Audit Patch](https://github.com/aviraxp/ZN-AuditPatch) module in the Apatch layer if necessary for vulnerability fixes

    - After rebooting, click the "Action" button of this module one or more times in the Magisk Manager to make it display "reset" and then click the "Action" button again to apply the latest rules if using the bindhosts module

### Special Cases

#### Momo

##### Package management service exception

Turn off "Disable package manager signature verification" in Core Patcher by referring to [a post in early 2023](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/633770792883881924.html)

##### Debugging mode is enabled

- Turn off the debugging mode when not in use
- It is not recommended to use plugins for bypassing because it will expose Xposed/Edxposed/LSPosed injection/hooks (confidence level), which is not worth the loss, though injecting the detection application can pass the debug mode (suspicious level)

##### Detect the existence of TWRP file(s)

Rename the TWRP folder under ``/sdcard/`` (for example, .TWRP)

##### Unlocked bootloader

- Install [Play Integrity fix](https://github.com/KOWX712/PlayIntegrityFix/actions) module
- It is not recommended to use plugins for bypassing because it will expose Xposed/Edxposed/LSPosed injection/hooks (confidence level), which is not worth the loss, though the injection of the detected application can pass the debug mode (suspicious level)

#### Ruru

##### Found HMA in ``syscall``

- Before June 24th, 2025: Switch to HMAL
- On or after June 24th, 2025: Install the latest HMA plugin

#### Native Root Detector

##### Detected Abnormal Environment (with a number with six decimal places as the detail)

- Update the Zygisk Next module to 1.3.0 and later. 
- Enable both anonymous memory and the Zygisk Next linker, or disable both of them in the Zygisk Next module. 

##### Detected Zygisk

Update the Zygisk Next module to 1.3.0 and later. 

##### LSPosed traces are detected in the ``odex`` file of GMS or this application

- Backup your plugin configurations in the LSPosed manager settings
- Uninstall Native Root Detector totally
- Disable WeChat and QQ (via Swift Backup or Fridge) if necessary
- Uninstall the original LSPosed in the root manager and reboot your device
- Install the lastest build in [https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed/actions](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed/actions) in the root manager and reboot your device
- Restore your plugin configurations in the LSPosed manager settings
- Switch to the plugin tab of the LSPosed manager to check whether the restoration of all plugin configurations is finished
- Reboot your device
- Install the latest Native Root Detector for detection (do not restore Native Root Detector from any backup)
- Enable WeChat and QQ only after the detector shows normal environments (except risky applications detected with Code 3)

##### Mount inconsistency detected / Magic Mount Detected

- Magisk and its branches: Use Magisk Alpha and install the latest Shamiko module
- Apatch and its branches: Embed the Cherish Peekaboo module as a kernel module (please check if the ``compat`` version is needed)
- KSU and its branches: Use SukiSU Ultra and Install the latest SUSFS module as a system module

##### Risky application detected (bypassed HMA(L) with Code 3)

The logic of this detection is to start an activity of the target application under Android 13. This detection is handled by ``HMA_v3.5`` from June 24th, 2025. 

##### Risky application detected (bypassed HMA(L) with Code 4)

The logic of this detection is to find folders named by the application package names recorded in the library under certain specific directories. Please try to check whether there is a folder named by the listed package names found by the detector in ``/sdcard/Android/data``. If the folder is empty, you can try to delete it. 
If necessary, please assign the listed application package names found by the detector to the variable ``packageNames`` with a space character as the separator. Subsequently, execute the following script as a non-root user to observe which folders named by the package names can be detected by applications without root permissions. 

```
#!/system/bin/sh
readonly EXIT_SUCCESS=0
readonly EXIT_FAILURE=1
exitCode=${EXIT_SUCCESS}
folders="/data/data /data/user/0 /data/user_de/0 /sdcard/Android/data"
packageNames="com.rifsxd.ksunext com.sukisu.ultra com.topjohnwu.magisk io.github.huskydg.magisk io.github.vvb2060.magisk me.bmax.apatch me.garfieldhan.apatch.next me.weishu.kernelsu"
for packageName in ${packageNames}
do
	for folder in ${folders}
	do
		if [[ -e "${folder}/${packageName}" ]];
		then
			exitCode=${EXIT_FAILURE}
			echo "Found \"${folder}/${packageName}\". "
		fi
	done
done
exit ${exitCode}
```

#### Native Test

##### Native Test reports "Malicious Hook" even though there are no rooting or injection environments

It is said by many people that this is a false negative. 

##### Others

Please refer to [https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-285106-1.htm](https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-285106-1.htm)

#### Postal Savings Bank

##### Around September 2023, the latest official mask and the latest Shamiko at that time were used, but the crash still occurred

- Caused by historical issues, updating can solve the problem
- Using the official Magisk or Magisk Alpha
  - If you were using the official Magisk or Magisk Alpha in around September 2023, please switch to the latest Magisk Delta
  - If you are using the official Magisk or Magisk Alpha today, please install the latest Magisk Alpha and the latest Shamiko module
- Using the Magisk Delta
  - If you were using the Magisk Delta in around September 2023, please install the latest Magisk Delta (the Magisk Delta at that time would not cause the Postal Savings Bank to crash)
  - If you are using the Magisk Delta today, please switch to the latest Magisk Alpha and install the latest Shamiko module

#### WeChat and QQ

##### Sending device risk alerts, deactivating users, restricting social features, or freezing accounts

- Mobile QQ (Android)
  - The definition of downgrading: Do not expose any suspicious environment (including root and injection environment) or perform any injection to QQ and use the core patcher plugin to downgrade QQ after 15 days (and observe for another 15 days)
  - If you are using a QQ version at or below ``v8.6.0``
    - Never upgrade the QQ until the update is a must
    - Upgrade to the minimum version above the current version if the update is a must
  - If you are using a QQ version within the interval (``v8.6.0``, ``v8.8.17``] that is affected by the 2021 spring and summer risk control event (the phenomenon is most obvious when using the ``v8.8.0`` version)
    - If you want to use the QXposed (QX) plugin or the QQ Repeater plugin while you can still downgrade your QQ
      - Switch to the ``v8.6.0`` or lower version (if rollback is still allowed)
    - Otherwise
      - Uninstall the QXposed (QX) plugin and the QQ Repeater plugin
      - Disable the red envelope grabbing, automatic group sign-in, and the group messaging functions
      - Uninstall any QQ plugin that is not adapted to the Xposed API calling protection of LSPosed
  - If you are using a QQ version within the interval (``v8.8.17``, ``v8.9.56``]
    - Never upgrade the QQ until the update is a must
    - Upgrade to the minimum version above the current version if the update is a must
    - Uninstall the QXposed (QX) plugin and the QQ Repeater plugin
    - Disable the red envelope grabbing, automatic group sign-in, and the group messaging functions
    - Uninstall any QQ plugin that is not adapted to the Xposed API calling protection of LSPosed
  - If you are using a QQ version above ``v8.9.56`` that is affected by the 2024 autumn to 2025 spring risk control event (the phenomenon is most obvious when using the ``v9.1.35`` version)
    - Please refer to the issues mentioned in (``v8.8.17``, ``v8.9.56``]
    - If you want to use the XAutoDaily (XA) plugin or the QAuxiliary (QA) plugin while you can still downgrade your QQ
      - Make sure that you have already hidden the rooting and injection environments according to the common procedures shown in this page
      - In the QAuxiliary (QA) plugin, turn on the "disable QQ hot patch" switch and turn off the "environment detection package (trpc.o3.*) interception" switch
      - Switch to the ``v9.1.31`` or lower versions, 
      - Switch to the ``v9.0.95`` or lower versions, or
      - Switch to the ``v8.9.56`` or lower versions (if accepting non-NT architecture)
    - Otherwise
      - Uninstall all the QQ plugins
      - Disable the red envelope grabbing, automatic group sign-in, and the group messaging functions
      - Do not expose any suspicious environment (including root and injection environment) or perform any injection to QQ (remember to disable QQ in advance when switching environments) when using versions above ``v9.1.31``
- Computer QQ (Windows): Always use the nostalgic version instead of the QQNT version

##### Failed to open the fingerprint payment prompt (but other domestic and foreign applications can use fingerprints normally)

- Temporary solution: Use the WeChat Payment module or the WeChat Payment plugin (the principle is to submit the pre-stored password after passing the fingerprint)
- Essential solution: None

##### Speculations about social media applications sending device risk alerts, deactivating users, restricting social features, or freezing accounts

Although some "TMLP" enthusiasts claim that WeChat and QQ restrictions are unrelated to their versions, with a detailed quantitative computation method proposed, our personal perspective is that the higher the version, the more "cold" code there is locally for environment detection, and the richer the support for "hot" code sent from the cloud for environment detection. 

For a long time, members of our team were often deactivated and restricted the next day after upgrading to a certain version during the major risk control periods. Downgrading to a version below that level only resulted in a warning, and downgrading to an even lower version or below eliminated any warnings, where, if the warnings were caused by the device ID being previously uploaded to the cloud, replacing the device is necessary. 

Furthermore, Android application-layer injection has been proven impossible to bypass by any third-party means. As long as the injected application wants to detect the injection, it can succeed. Secure bypassing is only possible by "controlling" all environment detection-related code within the target application while injecting. This requires plugin developers to conduct in-depth reverse engineering of the target application and make bold assumptions about the cloud.

## 过检方法

目前，SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + Zygisk Next（v1.3.0 及更高版本）是最好的 root + Zygisk 隐藏组合，其次为 Magisk Alpha + Zygisk Next（v1.3.0 及更高版本）、Apatch + Cherish Peekaboo + Zygisk Next（v1.3.0 及更高版本）和 Magisk Delta + 内置 Zygisk。

通过将 Magisk Fork 定义为包括 Magisk、KSU、Apatch 及其分支在内的 root 方案，将 Zygisk Fork 定义为内置 Zygisk 和其它 Zygisk 实现，将 LSPosed Fork 定义为 LSPosed 及其分支，过检的发展历程可以简要描述如下。

- Magisk + Xposed（2018 年及之前版本）；
- Magisk + Edxposed（2019 年）；
- Magisk + Edxposed + 各系防封检测插件（2020 年）；
- Magisk + LSPosed（2021 年）；
- Magisk + Zygisk + Shamiko + LSPosed（2022 年）；
- Magisk Fork + Zygisk Fork + Shamiko + LSPosed（2023 年）；
- Magisk Fork + Zygisk Fork + Shamiko + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS（2024 年）；
- Magisk Fork + Zygisk Fork + SUSFS/Shamiko + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS（2025 年第一季度）；
- Magisk Fork + Zygisk Fork + SUSFS/Shamiko/NoHello + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS + VBMeta Fixer + 残留清理（2025 年第二季度）；
- SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + Zygisk Next (v1.2.9.1 and before) + Shamiko + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS + VBMeta Fixer + Audit Patch + 残留清理（2025 年第三季度）以及；
- SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + Zygisk Next (v1.3.0 and later) + LSPosed Fork + PIF + TS + VBMeta Fixer + Audit Patch + 残留清理（2025 年第四季度）。

目前，即使使用了最先进的过检技术，以下问题依旧无法使用合适的方案解决。

- 隐藏自定义 ROM
- 隐藏 USB 调试甚至开发者选项
- 隐藏无障碍模式（甚至被作用的应用也无法检测到无障碍模式）
- 解决微信指纹支付开启失败而其它应用软件都能正常使用的问题
- 解决无合法 keybox 时无法在已解锁 bootloader 的设备上通过 STRONG 完整性检验
- 对被应用层注入的应用隐藏注入痕迹

在遵循教程的同时，还请考虑参考每个 root 方案、模块和插件的使用文档和 GitHub 存储库的 ``Actions`` 选项卡（如有）。

    - 在 SukiSU Ultra 层安装最新版 [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore) 模块
      - 如有需要可以不使用 Tricky Store 模块自带的 ``keybox.xml``
        - 使用 MT 管理器将 ``/data/adb/tricky_store/`` 目录中的 ``keybox.xml`` 并将其重命名为 ``keybox.xml.bak``（或在 root 权限下执行命令 ``mv /data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml /data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml.bak``）
        - 获取 ``keybox.xml``
          - 方法 1：在电报（Telegram）中搜索一个免费的、较近的 ``keybox.xml``（至少可以通过 Device（旧 Strong）完整性检验）（例如 [https://t.me/LSP_Leaks](https://t.me/LSP_Leaks)）$rightarrow$ 下载文件 $rightarrow$ 将文件重命名为``keybox.xml`` $rightarrow$ 使用 MT 管理器将其移动到 ``/data/adb/tricky_store/`` 目录下

          - 方法 4：使用 Google 认可的根证书生成 ``keybox.xml``（几乎不可能，因为我们大多数人都是普通人）
          - 方法 5：设计方法（包括可以在短时间内成功的暴破算法）来破解密码学方案（不可能，因为如果成功了，您可以在最顶级的密码学顶会上发表论文且使得全世界的相当一部分密码系统陷入危机）

        - 方法 2：在 Linux 操作系统中（通过 [https://github.com/TMLP-Team/keyboxGenerator](https://github.com/TMLP-Team/keyboxGenerator) 的 Python 脚本）生成一个 ``keybox.xml``（可以通过 Basic（旧 Device）完整性检验）$rightarrow$ 将生成的名为 ``keybox.xml`` 的文件复制到 Android 设备 $rightarrow$ 使用 MT 管理器将其移动到 ``/data/adb/tricky_store/`` 目录下
        - 方法 3：购买一个 ``keybox.xml``（可以通过 Strong 完整性检验）（但是，仅极少数情况下设备真的需要 Strong 完整性，而且，除非您能确保您购买的 ``keybox.xml`` 始终有效，或者将来旧密钥被撤销后售家会立即免费提供新的有效密钥，否则切勿购买 ``keybox.xml``，因为每个不是独享的 ``keybox.xml`` 都会在短时间内被 Google 吊销）
        - 方法 4：使用 Google 认可的根证书生成 ``keybox.xml``（几乎不可能，因为我们大多数人都是普通人）
        - 方法 5：设计方法（包括可以在短时间内成功的暴破算法）来破解密码学方案（不可能，因为如果成功了，您可以在最顶级的密码学顶会上发表论文且使得全世界的相当一部分密码系统陷入危机）
      - 如果需要，请检验完整性
        - Google 应用程序接口：使用 [密钥认证](https://github.com/vvb2060/KeyAttestation)
          - 您的 ``keybox.xml`` 在进行检验前被宣布或预计至少通过 Device（旧 Strong）完整性检验
            - 您的 ``keybox.xml`` 是私有的且您不会公开分享：请随意进行完整性检验，因为只要没有多个 Android 设备共享同一个 ``keybox.xml``，Google 很可能不会吊销您的 ``keybox.xml``
            - 您的 ``keybox.xml`` 是从公共渠道获取的或者您想公开分享它：这是可以接受的 $\leftarrow$ 但只要您的 ``keybox.xml`` 在多台 Android 设备上进行检查，基于 Google 应用程序接口的完整性检验将加速 Google 对其吊销 $\leftarrow$ 但是，如果您不手动进行完整性检验，您将难以信任它的完整性，而需要完整性检验的应用程序迟早会基于 Google 应用程序接口进行检查，这也会加速它的吊销 $\leftarrow$ 如果您的 Android 设备上没有这样的应用程序，只需使用 Tricky Store 模块带来的默认 ``keybox.xml`` 或您自己生成的 ``keybox.xml`` 即可
          - 您的 ``keybox.xml`` 在检查之前已宣布或预计会通过 Basic（旧 Device）完整性检查：请随意检查，因为从 Tricky Store 模块带来的默认 ``keybox.xml`` 或您自己生成的 ``keybox.xml`` 也可以通过 Basic（旧 Device）完整性检验，而且获取它们相当容易
        - 其它完整性检验应用程序：[https://github.com/TMLP-Team/TMLP-Detectors-and-Bypassers/tree/main/Detectors](https://github.com/TMLP-Team/TMLP-Detectors-and-Bypassers/tree/main/Detectors) 中的一些完整性检验应用程序会根据自己的云库（而非 Google 的云库）检查 ``keybox.xml`` 是否已被吊销
      - 如果 ``keybox.xml`` 已被吊销，或者其完整性比 Tricky Store 模块提供的默认 ``keybox.xml`` 更差，请在 MT 管理器中单击 ``/data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml.bak`` 以恢复备份
    - 使用 MT 管理器提取检测应用的安装包包名（可以长按复制）并编辑 ``/data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt`` 将所有目标应用的包名添加进去（黑名单模式）
    - ~~使用 MT 管理器编辑 ``/data/adb/tricky_store/security_patch.txt`` 并将当月或当季度的 1 号的日期按照 ``20251201`` 的格式写入该文件~~
  - 若设备的 vbmeta digest 不正确可在面具层安装最新版 [VBMeta Fixer](https://github.com/reveny/Android-VBMeta-Fixer) 模块
  - 如有修复漏洞需要可在面具层安装最新版 [Audit Patch](https://github.com/aviraxp/ZN-AuditPatch) 模块
  - 在面具层安装最新版 [bindhosts](https://github.com/backslashxx/bindhosts) 或内置的 Systemless hosts 模块
    - 由于两者不兼容，如果决定使用两者中的某一个模块，请移除另一个模块
    - 如果使用 bindhosts，请在重启设备后在面具管理器中点击一次或多次该模块的“操作”按钮使其显示 ``reset`` 后再点一次“操作”按钮使其应用最新规则

### 特殊情况

#### Momo

##### 包管理服务异常

在核心破解中关闭“禁用软件包管理器签名验证”（参考自[一篇 2023 年初的问答](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/633770792883881924.html)）

##### 已开启调试模式

- 在不使用调试模式时关闭调试模式
- 不建议使用插件进行过检因为对检测应用注入虽然能够过检掉调试模式（可疑级别）但会暴露 Xposed/Edxposed/LSPosed 注入/钩子（确信级别）反而得不偿失

##### 存在 TWRP 文件

将 ``/sdcard/`` 下的 TWRP 文件夹重命名（例如 .TWRP）

##### Bootloader 未锁定

- 在面具层安装最新版 [Play Integrity fix](https://github.com/KOWX712/PlayIntegrityFix/actions) 模块
- 不建议使用插件进行过检因为对检测应用注入虽然能够过检掉调试模式（可疑级别）但会暴露 Xposed/Edxposed/LSPosed 注入/钩子（确信级别）反而得不偿失

#### Ruru

##### 检测到挂载不一致 / 检测到 Magic Mount

- Magisk 系列：使用 Magisk Alpha 并安装最新版 Shamiko 模块
- Apatch 系列：以内核模块的形式嵌入 Cherish Peekaboo 模块（请自行排查是否需要 compat 版本）
- KSU 系列：使用 SukiSU Ultra 并安装最新版 SUSFS 模块

##### 检测到风险应用（绕过 HMA(L) 的代码 3）

该检测适用于安卓 13 以下的操作系统，通过启动目标应用的 Activity 实现检测，已于 2025 年 6 月 25 日在 ``HMA_v3.5.r449.1d951a3 (449)`` 中得到修复。

##### 检测到风险应用（绕过 HMA(L) 的代码 4）

该检测原理为找到了某些特定目录下存在以与库中记录的应用包名命名的文件夹，请尝试查看 ``/sdcard/Android/data`` 下是否存在以所列出包名命名的文件夹，如果该文件夹为空可尝试将其删除；
如有必要，请将所列出的应用包名以空格为分隔符赋值为变量 ``packageNames``，随后以普通用户身份执行以下脚本观察无 root 权限的应用可以检测到哪些以包名命名的文件夹。

```
#!/system/bin/sh
readonly EXIT_SUCCESS=0
readonly EXIT_FAILURE=1
exitCode=${EXIT_SUCCESS}
folders="/data/data /data/user/0 /data/user_de/0 /sdcard/Android/data"

  - 如果您现在正在使用 Magisk Delta，请切换到最新的 Magisk Alpha 并安装最新的 Shamiko 模块

#### 微信和 QQ

##### QQ 无故发送设备风险提醒、下线用户、限制社交功能或冻结账号

- 手机 QQ（安卓版）
  - 定义降级：不向 QQ 暴露任何可疑环境（含 root 和注入环境）或执行任何注入 15 天后利用核心破解插件降级 QQ（后再观察 15 天）
  - 如果您使用的 QQ 版本低于 ``v8.6.0``
    - 除非被云控强制升级否则请勿升级 QQ
    - 如被云控强制升级请升级到高于当前版本的最低版本
  - 如果您使用的 QQ 版本处于 2021 年春夏季节风控事件影响区间 (``v8.6.0``, ``v8.8.17``) 内（此现象在使用 ``v8.8.0`` 版本时最为明显）
    - 如果您想继续使用 QXposed（QX）插件或 QQ 复读机插件且 QQ 能够降级
      - 请切换到 ``v8.6.0`` 或更低版本
    - 否则
      - 请卸载 QXposed（QX）插件或 QQ 复读机插件
      - 请禁用抢红包、自动群签到和消息群发功能
      - 请卸载所有不适配 LSPosed 的 Xposed API 调用保护的 QQ 插件
  - 如果您使用的 QQ 版本处于 (``v8.8.17``, ``v8.9.56``] 区间内
    - 除非被云控强制升级否则请勿升级 QQ
    - 如被云控强制升级请升级到高于当前版本的最低版本
    - 请卸载 QXposed（QX）插件或 QQ 复读机插件
    - 请禁用抢红包、自动群签到和消息群发功能
    - 请卸载所有不适配 LSPosed 的 Xposed API 调用保护的 QQ 插件
  - 如果您使用的 QQ 版本高于 ``v8.9.56`` 且受 2024 年秋季至 2025 年春季风控事件影响（使用 ``v9.1.35`` 版本时现象最为明显）
    - 请参阅 (``v8.8.17``, ``v8.9.56``]
    - 如果您想使用 XAutoDaily（XA）插件或 QAuxiliary（QA）插件，并且仍然可以降级您的 QQ，请
      - 确保您已按照本页的通用流程隐藏 root 和注入环境
      - 在 QAuxiliary（QA）插件中打开禁用 QQ 热补丁开关并关闭环境检测包（trpc.o3.*）拦截开关
      - 切换到 ``v9.1.31`` 或更低版本，
      - 切换到 ``v9.0.95`` 或更低版本，或者
      - 切换到 ``v8.9.56`` 或更低版本（如果接受非 NT 架构）
    - 否则
      - 请卸载所有 QQ 插件
      - 请禁用抢红包、自动群签到和消息群发功能
      - 高于 ``v9.1.31`` 版本时切勿向 QQ 暴露（切换环境时记得提前禁用 QQ）任何可疑环境（含 root 和注入环境）或执行任何注入
- 电脑 QQ（Windows）：始终使用最新怀旧版而非 QQNT 版本

##### 微信开启指纹支付提示失败（但其它境内外应用都能正常使用指纹）

- 临时解决方法：使用微信支付模块或微信支付插件（原理是通过指纹后将预先存储的密码进行提交）
- 本质解决方法：暂无

##### 关于社交软件发送设备风险提醒、下线用户、限制社交功能或冻结账号的猜测

虽然部分“TMLP”爱好者表示微信和 QQ 的限制与版本无关，并总结出了一套详细的量化的计算公式，但个人感觉是版本越高，本地用于检测环境的“冷”代码就越多，对云端下发的用于检测环境的“热”代码的支持就越丰富。

长期以来，本团队中的成员经常在大型风控期间一越过某个版本第二天就被下线和限制，而降级至该版本以下就只会收到警告，再降级到某个更低的版本或以下就不再收到任何警告（当然如果之前是因为设备 ID 已经被上传到了云端而收到不断下发的警告则需要更换设备后警告才会被消除）。

另外，安卓应用层注入已被证明无法通过任何第三方手段对被注入的应用程序进行隐藏，只要被注入的应用程序想检测，就有手段检测到；只有在注入目标应用时将目标应用内所有与环境检测有关的代码“控制”住才可能实现安全的隐藏，而这，需要插件的开发人员对目标应用进行极为深入的逆向分析以及对云端的大胆揣测。
